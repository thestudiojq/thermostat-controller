# Configuring the app

Thermostat Controller is an iPhone app that lets you view the data from and control your Venstar thermostat locally.

You can view the current temperature, set temperature, humidity, fan state and runtimes, including a readout of all the runtimes from the past week as well as the average daily runtime for the past week.

You can also control your thermostat, with the ability to increase/decrease the set temperature, change the mode (heating, cooling, auto) and change the fan mode (always on or auto).

Optional push notifications are available to let you know when the thermostat state changes from idle to active (e.g. heating or cooling) or vice versa. These push notifications require the companion app to be running on a computer as well as an API key. More info [here](https://www.studiojq.io/thermostat-controller/).
