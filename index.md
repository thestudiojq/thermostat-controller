# About

**Thermostat Controller** is an iPhone app that lets you view the data from and control your **Venstar** thermostat locally.

## Data you can view

* Current temperature
* Set temperature
* Humidity
* Mode
* Fan state
* Runtimes
  * Today's runtime
  * Runtime for each day of the past week
  * The average daily runtime for the past week

## What you can control

* Increase/decrease the set temperature
* Change the mode (heating, cooling, auto)
* Change the fan mode (always on or auto)

## Push notifications

Optional push notifications are available to let you know when the thermostat state changes from idle to active (e.g. heating or cooling) or vice versa. These push notifications require the companion app to be running on a computer as well as an API key. More info [here]({{ 'push' | relative_url }}).
